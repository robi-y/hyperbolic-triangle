The notebook would primarily focus on the logarithmic hyperbolic distribution and its application to sand size distributions and erosion-deposition processes.
1. Setup and Libraries
• Import necessary libraries: numpy for numerical operations, scipy.stats (potentially for distribution fitting), matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, and possibly pandas for data handling if raw data were available.
2. Logarithmic Hyperbolic Distribution (LHD)
This section would define and implement the core mathematical functions of the LHD.
• Probability Density Function (PDF):
    ◦ The paper defines the PDF for the LHD as p(x;μ,δ,χ,ξ). This function would be implemented using the provided formula.
    ◦ Formula: p(x;μ,δ,χ,ξ) = α(δ,φ,γ) exp{−(1/δ)√(δ²+ (x−μ)²)+ φ(x−μ)}.
        ▪ Where α(δ,φ,γ) = (γ/(δπ)) K₁(δγ) exp(μ(φ−γ)) is a normalizing constant.
        ▪ And K₁(.) is a modified Bessel function of the third kind and order 1.
        ▪ The relationship between φ and γ is φ = χ/δ and γ = ξ/δ.
        ▪ The parameters χ and ξ are invariant under transformations of location and scale.
• Location, Scale, Skewness, and Kurtosis:
    ◦ The LHD is described by parameters μ (location), δ (scale), χ (skewness), and ξ (kurtosis).
    ◦ The skewness γ₁ and kurtosis γ₂ are related to the shape triangle parameters χ and ξ.
    ◦ The paper mentions that γ₁ and γ₂ can be calculated from φ and γ. An implementation would need specific formulas for γ₁ and γ₂ in terms of φ and γ which are not fully detailed for direct calculation in the provided excerpts, but are stated to be functions of φ and γ.
• Parameter Transformations:
    ◦ Equations defining μ, δ, χ, and ξ from other forms (e.g., in terms of v and τ) would be implemented.
    ◦ Formula: v = μ+δ(φ−γ)/(1−(φγ)).
    ◦ Formula: τ = δ⁻¹(δχ)(1−ρ²).
    ◦ Formula: χ = ((φ−γ)/(φ+γ)).
    ◦ Formula: ξ = (1+δγ(φγ)⁻¹).
3. Hyperbolic Shape Triangle
This section would involve plotting the domain of the shape parameters.
• Regenerate Figure 1: This figure shows the domain of the invariant parameters χ and ξ.
    ◦ The triangle depicts the general hyperbolic distribution (N), normal distribution (L), Laplace distribution (H), and exponential distribution (E).
    ◦ To reproduce this, the boundary lines of the triangle (H+, H-, E, L, N points) would need to be defined based on the parameter ranges mentioned (e.g., χ from -1.0 to 1.0, ξ from 0.0 to 1.0).
    ◦ Plotting of various probability functions within this domain would require selecting specific (χ, ξ) values and generating their corresponding PDF curves. The specific (χ, ξ) values used for curves (b) and (c) in Figure 1 are not provided.
• Regenerate Figure 5, 7, 8: These figures plot observed data points from different environments (dune, microtidal flat, marine) on the hyperbolic shape triangle.
    ◦ To reproduce these, the numerical (χ, ξ) values for each sample point (e.g., points 1-28 for dune, 1-8 for microtidal flat, etc.) would be required, which are not present in the sources. The figures show the points, but not their coordinates.
4. Erosion and Deposition Model
This section would implement the mathematical model for erosion-deposition.
• Steady State Probability Density Function:
    ◦ The paper defines π(s) as the proportion of grains of size s present after erosion.
    ◦ Formula: π(s) = c₀sᵏ.
    ◦ The erosion-deposition model uses cp(s) as the probability density function for grain size s at the start, and cp(s) exp(ωs) after a period of net erosion.
    ◦ Formula: cp(s) exp(ωs).
    ◦ The parameter ω represents the total amount of change in the distribution. For erosion, ω < 0.
• Time Evolution of Parameters:
    ◦ The change in distribution over a time interval (t, t+dt) is described by equations for χ(t) and β(t).
    ◦ Formula: d/dt (χ(t)) = −εκ(t).
    ◦ Formula: d/dt (β(t)) = −εκρ(t).
    ◦ Where ε is a constant and κ(t) and ρ(t) are functions related to the distribution.
    ◦ Formula: κ(t) = χ.
    ◦ Formula: λ(t)/κ(t) = σ(t)−1/(σ(t)+1).
    ◦ Formula: ρ(t) = β(t)/χ(t).
    ◦ These differential equations would need to be solved numerically (e.g., using scipy.integrate.odeint) to simulate the evolution of χ and β over time.
    ◦ The relationship χ = βξexp(−εκdt)/(1−ρ²) is given for ε-erosion-deposition.
• Regenerate Figure 2, 3, 4, 6: These figures illustrate the erosion-deposition process.
    ◦ Figure 2 shows erosion-deposition curves on the shape triangle. Figure 4 shows the curve for κ/ε vs. χ/ε. Figure 3 depicts the deviation from the straight line due to deposition.
    ◦ To reproduce these, the specific initial parameters (e.g., χ₀, β₀, ε), and the range of dt or t values used for simulation, would be necessary. The paper provides illustrative curves (e.g., for ε=0, ε=1, ε=3, ε=15 in Figure 4) but not the full dataset to generate the curves themselves.
5. Data Visualization and Analysis
This section would handle plotting the distributions and comparing them to observations.
• Regenerate Figure 9 & 10: These figures show observed and estimated log-grain size distributions.
    ◦ To regenerate these, the raw grain size data for each sample (e.g., S2, S8, S18 for dune material, and various samples for marine material) would be needed. This data is not provided in the excerpts.
    ◦ If the raw data were available, the notebook would involve:
        ▪ Loading the data.
        ▪ Calculating histograms or density estimates of the log(d/mm) values.
        ▪ Fitting the LHD to the observed data to obtain estimated parameters (μ, δ, χ, ξ) for each sample.
        ▪ Plotting the observed distributions alongside the fitted LHDs.
Missing Information Summary:
To fully realize this notebook, the following critical information, which is not present in the provided sources, would be required:
• Raw numerical data points for all figures depicting empirical distributions or parameter plots (e.g., Figures 5, 7, 8, 9, 10).
• Specific initial conditions and parameter values used to generate the theoretical curves in figures (e.g., for Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).
• Detailed step-by-step algorithms or numerical methods used for calculations, beyond the explicit formulas (e.g., for LHD fitting, solving differential equations, or parameter derivations not explicitly given as simple algebraic expressions).
• The exact formulas for γ₁ and γ₂ (skewness and kurtosis) in terms of φ and γ that are mentioned but not fully written out for direct computation.
In conclusion, while the paper provides the foundational equations and conceptual graphs, creating a functional Python notebook to reproduce all calculations and figures would necessitate access to the original datasets and specific computational parameters, which are outside the scope of the provided excerpts.
